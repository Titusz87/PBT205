/*

• Write a ‘chat’ command-line application:
o Start-up arguments:
 A username;
 The middleware endpoint (TCP port).

o Behaviour:
 Upon starting up, it should subscribe to the above topic;
 Any messages that other users post should be printed to the console, along
with the username of whoever posted the message;
 Any messages entered by the user (terminated by a carriage return) should
be sent to the chat room for the other participants to see.

Final Product
• Expose the chat application over a simple GUI interface in which multiple users can log in and
join a ‘room’ and begin chatting.
• Extend the application to allow for multiple rooms, so that a user can select the room they
wish to join upon logging in.
