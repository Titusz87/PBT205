Task 2 Instructions—Trading System

Specification

You will be modelling a very simple market and exchange in which there is only one stock (XYZ Corp).
All orders must have a desired price expressed on the order (this should be distinguished from ‘market
orders’ in industry).

This will be enabled by two (2) actors:
1. The Exchange: There can only be one (1) exchange. It is responsible for matching orders from
traders against one another and publishing ‘done trades’ along with the price they were
traded at; and
2. The Trader: There can be multiple traders, each with a unique identifier.
