Task 3 Instructions—Contact Tracing

Specification

You are modelling a given environment as a two-dimensional system of coordinates (like a very large
chess board). The virtual size of the board is 10 x 10, but should be configurable for up to 1,000 x 1,000.
You and your colleagues will start at a randomised position in this environment and can move one
square only in any direction (similar to a King’s movement in chess). 

Each person will have a unique identifier (for simplicity, you can simply use a first name as an identifier in this environment (provided that the name is unique) to monitor the activity.

Your role is to list colleagues that you have come into contact with (i.e., other people who have
occupied the same square at the same time).

Unlike chess, multiple people can occupy a single square simultaneously and there is no concept of
‘rounds‘ (in which each player is allowed to make a single move, turn by turn). Further, each person
can frequent the same square as often as they wish and can move to new squares as frequently as
they wish.
